# OnSite Club — Full AI Context (llms-full.txt)

> OnSite Club is a construction lifestyle brand based in Ontario, Canada.
> We build gear, digital tools, and a community for people who work in construction.

## Mission

OnSite Club exists for construction workers — the ones who pour, frame, wire, and finish.
Our mission: make it easier to gear up, track your hours, pass your certs, and rep your trade.

Buildings don't remember who built them. We do.

This city didn't build itself. Somebody woke up before the sun, scraped ice, put on boots
that already hurt, and made something real. OnSite Club exists because that somebody deserves
more than a paycheck. They deserve a name on what they built. We make gear, tools, and a crew
for the people whose work everyone sees but nobody credits.

## Website Structure (Single-Page Homepage)

The homepage is a single-page layout with sections in this order:

1. **Hero** — Main landing section with brand intro and CTA
2. **Tools** — Digital tools showcase (Calculator, Timekeeper, etc.)
3. **Gear** — Apparel and merchandise (links to shop.onsiteclub.ca). Previously labeled "Shop" on the homepage.
4. **Manifesto** — Standalone emotional break section featuring the quote: "Buildings don't remember who built them. We do."
5. **LearnTeaser** — Three cards linking to educational articles: /learn/construction-steps, /learn/safety-equipment, and /learn/trades-guide
6. **Contact** — Contact information and social links

**Removed from homepage:**
- The **Pathway** section (construction certification guide) is no longer displayed on the single-page homepage. The content still exists and may be used on a dedicated page in the future.
- The **Community** section is no longer displayed on the single-page homepage. The 250+ members counter has been removed from the homepage and is saved for a future /community page.
