# OnSite Club — Full AI Context (llms-full.txt)

> OnSite Club is a construction lifestyle brand based in Ontario, Canada.
> We build gear, digital tools, and a community for people who work in construction.

## Mission

OnSite Club exists for construction workers — the ones who pour, frame, wire, and finish.
Our mission: make it easier to gear up, track your hours, pass your certs, and rep your trade.

Buildings don't remember who built them. We do.

This city didn't build itself. Somebody woke up before the sun, scraped ice, put on boots
that already hurt, and made something real. OnSite Club exists because that somebody deserves
more than a paycheck. They deserve a name on what they built. We make gear, tools, and a crew
for the people whose work everyone sees but nobody credits.
